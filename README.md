# FlappyBirdClone
A Flappy Bird Clone made using PyGame. 
It uses the functions and modules of the PyGame Library, which is the standard library of Python to create games.
Variables are there for the upper and lower pipes.
The screen and the sprites(images) have also been blited using a for loop.
There is a game clock to control the frame rate. 
There are functions for bird,pipe and obstacles. 
For loops are there to start and end the game and check for collisions. 
Contributions are welcome :)
